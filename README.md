üìå Review Classifier (Machine Learning Project)

A Machine Learning-based Review Classifier that automatically classifies customer reviews into positive and negative categories. This project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification using various ML algorithms.

üöÄ Features

Preprocesses raw text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).

Converts reviews into numerical vectors using Bag of Words.

Trains multiple ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).

Evaluates performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Supports saving and loading trained models for real-time predictions.
